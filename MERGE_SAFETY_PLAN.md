# Merge Safety Plan — Data Integrity Protocol

**Status:** 🟢 ACTIVE  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-22

---

## Core Principle

**Every merge must preserve:**
- ✅ All historical commits (never force-push)
- ✅ All data files (JSONL append-only)
- ✅ All test coverage
- ✅ All features from both branches

---

## Pre-Merge Checklist

### 1. Backup Critical Data (Always First)
```bash
# Before ANY merge, backup:
cp spec1_intelligence.jsonl spec1_intelligence.jsonl.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
cp spec1.db spec1.db.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

**What to backup:**
- `spec1_intelligence.jsonl` (append-only record store)
- `spec1.db` (SQLite index)
- `.env` (credentials, if tracked)

**Where:** Store in `backups/` directory (git-ignored)

---

### 2. Verify Both Branches Are Clean
```bash
# Current branch
git status --porcelain
# Should be: clean (no untracked files in src/)

# Target branch
git diff main origin/main
# Should be: fast-forward or mergeable

# Check for merge conflicts in advance
git merge --no-commit --no-ff <branch>
git merge --abort  # Don't actually merge yet
```

**Must pass:** Zero untracked code changes

---

### 3. Run Tests Before Merge
```bash
# On current branch
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -q --tb=short

# On target branch (origin/main)
git fetch origin
git log origin/main -1 --oneline
# Verify latest commit
```

**Must pass:** All tests green

---

## Merge Strategy

### Safe Merge Pattern (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Create explicit merge commit (never fast-forward)
git merge origin/main --no-ff \
  -m "Merge branch 'origin/main' into <your-branch>

Data integrity preserved:
- Backup: spec1_intelligence.jsonl.backup-TIMESTAMP
- Tests: All passing before merge
- Commits: All historical commits preserved
- Features: Zero loss from either branch"

# 2. If conflicts occur, STOP and resolve carefully
git status
# Review each conflict
git diff --check  # No whitespace issues
```

**Why `--no-ff`?**
- Creates explicit merge commit (preserves history)
- Easy to revert if needed
- Clear record of what was merged

---

## Conflict Resolution

### If Merge Conflicts Appear

**Step 1: Pause**
```bash
git merge --abort  # Go back to before merge
# Do NOT proceed until conflicts understood
```

**Step 2: Analyze the conflict**
```bash
# Find what's conflicting
git diff main <your-branch> -- <file>

# Check git blame for both versions
git blame -L<start>,<end> <file>
```

**Step 3: Resolve strategically**

**By file type:**

| File Type | Strategy | Rule |
|-----------|----------|------|
| `.py` code | Manual merge | Keep both features, test |
| `JSONL` data | Append both | Never delete records |
| `.json` config | Manual merge | Prefer newer version |
| Tests | Keep all | Combine test coverage |
| Docs | Keep all | Merge content, not overwrite |

**For JSONL conflicts:**
```bash
# NEVER truncate. Append new records:
# File A: {a: 1}\n{a: 2}\n
# File B: {b: 1}\n{b: 2}\n
# Result: {a: 1}\n{a: 2}\n{b: 1}\n{b: 2}\n
```

**Step 4: Verify merged result**
```bash
# After manual resolution:
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts

Conflicts resolved in: <files>
Data integrity: Verified (no records lost)
Tests: Re-run before push"

# Re-run tests
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -q
```

---

## Post-Merge Verification

### Verify Nothing Was Lost

```bash
# 1. Check line count (JSONL should grow or stay same, never shrink)
wc -l spec1_intelligence.jsonl
# Compare to backup:
wc -l spec1_intelligence.jsonl.backup-*

# 2. Validate JSONL format (each line is valid JSON)
jq -s 'length' spec1_intelligence.jsonl
# Should show: total record count

# 3. Run full test suite
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -q --cov=src

# 4. Check git history
git log --oneline -5
# Verify merge commit is there
```

**All checks must PASS before pushing**

---

## Push to Remote

### Safe Push Pattern
```bash
# 1. Verify local is ahead of remote
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
# Should show: your commits

# 2. Push with verification
git push origin <branch>

# 3. Do NOT force-push
# ❌ NEVER: git push --force
# ✅ ALWAYS: git push (standard push only)
```

**If push rejected:**
```bash
# Remote has work you don't have locally
git pull origin <branch>  # Merge remote into local
# Repeat merge safety checks
git push origin <branch>
```

---

## Branch Protection Rules

**Set on GitHub:**
```
Repository Settings → Branches → Add rule

Branch name pattern: main

Require status checks to pass:
  ✅ python-package.yml (all 4 Python versions)
  ✅ pages.yml (GitHub Pages)

Require code review:
  ✅ Dismiss stale reviews on new commits

Require branches to be up to date before merging:
  ✅ Yes

Require linear history:
  ✅ Yes (no merge commits — use rebase)
```

**Effect:** Cannot merge without passing CI + 0 conflicts

---

## Backup Retention

### Keep backups for safety net

**Location:** `.gitignore`d `backups/` directory
```
backups/
├── spec1_intelligence.jsonl.backup-20260522-143000
├── spec1_intelligence.jsonl.backup-20260522-160000
└── spec1.db.backup-20260522-143000
```

**Retention:** Keep last 7 backups (auto-cleanup older)

**Recovery procedure** (if needed):
```bash
# If merge corrupted data:
cp backups/spec1_intelligence.jsonl.backup-<timestamp> \
   spec1_intelligence.jsonl

git reset --hard <commit-before-merge>
git push origin main --force
```

---

## Workflow for Future Branches

### When starting new work:

```bash
# 1. Start from latest main
git fetch origin
git checkout -b <your-feature> origin/main

# 2. Make changes, commit often
git commit -m "feat: description"

# 3. Before pushing, sync with main
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main --no-ff \
  -m "Sync with main before PR"

# 4. Run all checks
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -q
git diff main --stat  # Verify changes

# 5. Push to create PR
git push origin <your-feature>

# 6. On GitHub: Create PR, request review
# CI runs automatically
# Merge via GitHub UI (requires passing checks)

# 7. After merge, cleanup local
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d <your-feature>  # Delete local
```

---

## Emergency Recovery

### If data IS lost despite precautions:

**Step 1: STOP pushing**
```bash
git push origin --force-with-lease  # ❌ DO NOT DO THIS
```

**Step 2: Restore from backup**
```bash
cp backups/spec1_intelligence.jsonl.backup-<latest> \
   spec1_intelligence.jsonl

git add spec1_intelligence.jsonl
git commit -m "Restore data from backup (incident #X)"
```

**Step 3: Notify team**
```
Incident: Data loss in merge
Time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
Affected: spec1_intelligence.jsonl
Recovery: Restored from backup-TIMESTAMP
Impact: Zero records lost
Status: Resolved
```

**Step 4: Root cause analysis**
- What caused the loss?
- How to prevent next time?
- Update this plan if needed
