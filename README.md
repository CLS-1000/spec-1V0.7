The bottleneck is attention, not access.

Authoritative reporting is abundant. The constraint is analyst hours — the time it takes to triage thousands of items down to the dozen that matter today. SPEC-1 handles that triage automatically: it monitors a curated set of national-security and regional-accountability sources continuously, scores every incoming signal through a four-gate deterministic filter, and hands only the survivors to Claude for investigation and verification. What reaches the analyst is already classified, scored, and structured — ready for a decision, not a digest.

**The system handles the volume. The analyst handles the judgment.**

```
>> SYSTEM METADATA LOG
* Analyst Impact:  You start your day with filtered signal. Hours of manual
                   reading replaced by a verified, structured brief.
* Programmer Impact: A unified fault-tolerant ingestion architecture.
                   A dead RSS feed will not halt the 06:00 AM cron job.

## Architecture

A four-step deterministic lifecycle separates signal from noise.

```
[RAW SIGNAL] ──→ [OPPORTUNITY] ──→ [INVESTIGATION] ──→ [INTELLIGENCE]
   High volume       Filtered by        Augmented with      Structured
  RSS/Atom feeds    4-Gate System       Claude API          output & briefs
        │
        ▼
   /dev/null
   NOISE DISCARDED
```

Seven sequential stages — engineered for graceful degradation.

```
[01 HARVEST] > [02 PARSE] > [03 SCORE] > [04 INVESTIGATE] > [05 VERIFY] > [06 ANALYZE] > [07 STORE]
```

| Stage | What happens | Output |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `[01 HARVEST]` | SSL edge cases, malformed XML, timeouts — failed feeds logged and skipped | `Signal[]` |
| `[02 PARSE]` | BeautifulSoup + NLP heuristics. No external model dependencies | `ParsedSignal[]` |
| `[03 SCORE]` | Four-gate filter — any single failure drops the signal | `Opportunity[]` |
| `[04 INVESTIGATE]` | Claude generates hypothesis + analyst leads | `Investigation[]` |
| `[05 VERIFY]` | Claude classifies outcome against evidence tree | `Outcome[]` |
| `[06 ANALYZE]` | Confidence synthesis — sources, analysts, corroboration | `IntelligenceRecord[]` |
| `[07 STORE]` | Dual-write: append-only JSONL + SQLite. JSONL is source of truth | persisted |

---

## The 4-Gate Scoring System

Any single failure drops the signal to `/dev/null`.

| Gate | Criterion | Default |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `[CREDIBILITY]` | Known source / analyst weight ≥ 0.60 | 0.60 |
| `[VOLUME]` | Word count ≥ 50 | 50 words |
| `[VELOCITY]` | Signal recency ≤ 48 hours | 48h |
| `[NOVELTY]` | Not a duplicate — keyword domain match ≥ 1 | hash dedup |

Thresholds encode accumulated operational judgment. Gate weights remain unpublished.

## Intelligence Adapters

The core pipeline adapts to specialized intelligence domains.
