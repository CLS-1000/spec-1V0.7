## The Problem Intelligence Operations Face

Intelligence analysts face a paradox: drowning in data but starving for insight.

Every day, credible reporting flows from dozens of authoritative sources. The signal-to-noise ratio is brutal. By the time an analyst manually triages the week's feeds, actionable intelligence has grown cold. The bottleneck isn't information access. It's human attention.

SPEC-1 solves this differently.

---

## What SPEC-1 Does

SPEC-1 is a production-grade automated intelligence triage engine that ingests 40+ curated open-source feeds and transforms them into verified, analyst-ready briefs through a deterministic, zero-bypass filtration pipeline.

**Result:** Analysts make high-stakes judgments about verified signals, not manually sort noise.

---

## Why SPEC-1 Is Different

### Strict Filtration

SPEC-1 rejects black-box scoring. The pipeline enforces a zero-bypass policy:

**All four gates must pass, or the signal is discarded.**

Each gate is deterministic, fully logged, and defensible:
- **Provenance Gate:** Source credibility baseline (≥0.75 required)
- **Complexity Gate:** Signals must be novel or actionable
- **Recency Gate:** Fresher intelligence outranks stale reporting
- **Anomaly Gate:** Deep semantic validation for narrative inconsistencies

Analysts see exactly why each signal passed. No mystery. No hidden scoring.

### Enterprise Reliability

- **Immutable audit trail:** All intelligence is append-only. Complete provenance.
- **Failure-first design:** Every stage is heavily logged. Pipeline never crashes.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Thresholds never auto-calibrate. Humans decide.
- **SLA-ready:** 59 tests, 1,300+ assertions. 100% success rate. <100ms API latency.

### Three-Tier LLM Fallback

Semantic verification never blocks:

Tier 1: Claude Haiku (optimized for speed)  
Tier 2: Local Ollama (zero-cost fallback)  
Tier 3: Deterministic rules (always works)

## Getting Started

Installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjlak1000/spec-1.git
cd spec-1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env
# Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env
```

First Run:
```bash
make cycle                # Complete pipeline
make run                  # API server
make test                 # Test suite
```

See [docs/runbook.md](docs/runbook.md) for production deployment.

## Philosophy

SPEC-1 is engineered on one principle: the system does mechanical work; humans make judgments.

Analysts should never waste time in noise. The pipeline is strict, deterministic, and fully auditable because intelligence decisions require accountability. Every signal has been verified multiple times. Every threshold change is human-approved. Every decision is logged.

The system's job: eliminate the 90% of noise so humans focus on the 10% that matters.
