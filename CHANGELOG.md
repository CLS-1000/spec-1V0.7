Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- `cls_quant` — quantitative market intelligence module removed (out of scope for core triage mission; market demand not validated). `SPEC1_QUANT_ENABLED` env var, `install-quant` Makefile target, and numpy/yfinance optional deps have all been cleaned up.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- **API versioning (Task 1.3):** All `spec1_api` routes are now under `/api/v1/` prefix (e.g., `GET /api/v1/health`, `POST /api/v1/verdicts`). Resolves naming ambiguity with legacy `spec1_engine.api` which was already versioned.
- **Verdict-filing web UI (Task 1.5):** `GET /verdicts/` serves a single-page HTML form for filing human verdicts. Loads recent intel records, lets reviewer pick a verdict kind, and submits to `POST /api/v1/verdicts`.
- **Dual-write for leads, briefs, psyop (Task 1.6):** `LeadStore`, `BriefStore`, and `PsyopStore` now accept an optional `db` parameter. When provided, every write goes to both JSONL and SQLite via `DualWriter`. `spec1_api.dependencies` wires the database automatically. JSONL remains the source of truth.
- **New documentation (Task 1.7):** `docs/quickstart.md`, `docs/deployment.md`, `docs/customization.md`, `docs/api-integration.md`.

### Changed
- `docs/runbook.md`: Updated API paths to `/api/v1/...`, removed quant section, added verdict web UI reference.
- `docs/architecture.md`: Removed re-export shim rows and `cls_quant` row.
- `Makefile`: Removed `install-quant` target.
- `.env.example`: Removed `SPEC1_QUANT_ENABLED`.
- `README.md`: Removed `SPEC1_QUANT_ENABLED` row from env var table.

### Removed
- `cls_quant` references across docs, Makefile, and env templates (code was never shipped).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- `cls_verdicts` — append-only human ground-truth store (`Verdict`, `VerdictKind`)
- `cls_calibration` — descriptive drift surfacing (aggregator, proposer, formatter); never auto-tunes
- `cls_db` — structured persistence layer: SQLite connection pool, ORM models, dual-write, migration runner
- `spec1_api` — canonical FastAPI application with APScheduler daily cron
  - Routers: `/health`, `/signals`, `/intel`, `/leads`, `/brief`, `/psyop`, `/fara`, `/verdicts`, `/calibration`, `/cycle/run`
- `mcp_server.py` — MCP server exposing 12 tools to Claude (`run_cycle`, `get_signals`, `get_intel`, `get_leads`, `get_brief`, `get_psyop`, `get_fara`, `analyse_psyop`, `get_stats`, `file_verdict`, `get_verdicts`, `get_calibration`)
- `spec1_engine.workspace` — persistent investigation case files (case, tracker, researcher, CLI)
- `spec1_engine.tools` — operational CLIs: `historical_briefs`, `calibration_propose`, `pdf_render`
- DPRK/Korea intelligence layer — 38 North, NK News, CSIS Korea, Yonhap feeds + dedicated fuel-supply signal loop
- Portland Political Web signal loop — 4-gate ingest + node tooltip API
- `cls_db.publish_log` — publication audit trail
- `spec1_api.static` — portfolio and UI HTML served at `/`
- X publisher integration (`test_x_publisher.py`)
- `WorldStateBrief` value objects and brief schemas (`test_brief_schemas.py`)
- PDF render subprocess (`spec1_engine.tools.pdf_render`) — weasyprint isolated out-of-process

### Changed
- Briefing template replaced with WORLD STATE BRIEF design
- `spec1_engine.briefing` now always falls back to rule-based brief on API error
- `DEFAULT_FEEDS` expanded from 6 to 10 sources

### Fixed
- Missing-file guard on `GET /` UI route
- Test assertion for `DEFAULT_FEEDS` count updated for DPRK sources

- `cls_quant` — quantitative market intelligence (4-sector watchlist: defense, cyber, energy, macro via yfinance)
- `cls_leads` — actionable intelligence lead generation and formatting
- `cls_world_brief` — daily world intelligence brief (producer, formatter, store)
- `cls_osint.adapters` — FARA, congressional, and narrative adapters
- `spec1_engine.congressional` — congressional records (collector, parser, scorer, analyzer, cycle)
- `spec1_engine.quant` — market signal cycle (collector, parser, scorer, analyzer)
- `spec1_engine.analysts` — analyst registry, credibility weighting, discovery
- Re-export shims: `spec1_engine.cls_leads`, `spec1_engine.cls_psyop`, `spec1_engine.cls_world_brief`

- Sacred-geometry PDF brief template (later replaced in v0.4.0)

### Changed
- Briefing generator upgraded to Claude Sonnet from rule-based only

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- `spec1_engine.investigation` — hypothesis generator and Claude Haiku verifier
  - Outcome classifications: Corroborated, Escalate, Investigate, Monitor, Conflicted, Archive
- `spec1_engine.intelligence` — analyzer (blends confidence signals) and JSONL store
- `spec1_engine.briefing` — daily brief generator with rule-based fallback
- `cls_osint` — extended OSINT adapters (feed fetcher, OSINT record schemas, pipeline, store)
- `spec1_engine.core.prompts/` — authoritative prompt `.md` files (frozen)
- Frozen core governance: `src/spec1_engine/core/` declared off-limits for ad-hoc edits
- `spec1_engine.api` — legacy in-engine FastAPI mount (superseded by `spec1_api` in v0.4.0)

### Changed
- Scorer now produces `Opportunity` objects (not raw signals) for downstream stages
- Pipeline wired end-to-end: harvest → parse → score → investigate → verify → analyze → store
