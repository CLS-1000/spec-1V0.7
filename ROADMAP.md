# SPEC-1 STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN
## 26-Week Roadmap: From Portfolio Project to Sustainable Product
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Last Updated:** May 2026  
**Owner:** Matt Lakamp (EVASTARARCANA LLC)  
**Contact:** spec1_ops@proton.me
---
## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
**Current State:** v0.5.0, mature codebase (736 tests), incomplete market positioning  
**Target State:** Sustainable product business with $10-20K MRR, 10-20 paying customers, 100+ active users  
**Timeline:** 26 weeks (6 months)  
**Resource Estimate:** 1 FTE engineering + 0.5 FTE sales/marketing (Phase 2+)
---
## REPOSITORY STRATEGY

```
Phase 1-2 (NOW):
mjlak1000/spec-1                    ← everything here (code, API, tests, docs)
  └── src/
      ├── spec1_core/               ← organizationally separated (same repo)
      ├── spec1_analytics/          ← organizationally separated (same repo)
      └── spec1_api/

Phase 2 Week 9 (new repo, marketing only):
mjlak1000/spec-1                    ← code, unchanged
mjlak1000/spec-1-marketing          ← NEW: portfolio site (Next.js + Vercel)

Phase 3+ (optional — only if licensing or team boundaries justify it):
spec-1-core                         ← AGPL open-source engine (extracted)
spec-1-analytics                    ← Proprietary analytics layer (extracted)
spec-1-saas                         ← Proprietary SaaS layer (extracted)
```

**Default assumption:** monorepo (`mjlak1000/spec-1`) is fine through Phase 3.
A repo split is a deliberate decision gate, not an automatic outcome.

## PHASE 1: CONSOLIDATION & CLARITY (Weeks 1-8)
### Goal: Fix architectural loose ends and prepare for external users
### Week 1-2: Foundation Fixes
#### TASK 1.1: Resolve Quant Module Decision
- **Status:** ✅ DONE — Decision: **REMOVE** (option A)
- **Decision:** Remove entirely — orthogonal to core triage mission; market demand not validated
- **Deliverables:**
  - [x] Decision documented in CHANGELOG
  - [x] Code removed (cls_quant never shipped; references cleaned from docs, Makefile, .env.example, README)
  - [x] All tests passing
  - [x] pyproject.toml has no quant extras
- **Commits:**
  - `chore: remove quant module references (out of scope)`
---
#### TASK 1.2: Consolidate Module Naming (Remove Re-export Shims)
- **Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Current Problem:**
  - `spec1_analytics.cls_leads` is alias to `cls_leads`
  - `spec1_analytics.cls_psyop` is alias to `cls_psyop`
  - `spec1_analytics.cls_world_brief` is alias to `cls_world_brief`
  - These suggest a future refactor that never happened
- **Solution:** Remove all re-export shims; always import from top-level modules
- **Time Estimate:** 2-3 days
- **Deliverables:**
  - [ ] `spec1_analytics/cls_leads.py` → DELETED
  - [ ] `spec1_analytics/cls_psyop.py` → DELETED
  - [ ] `spec1_analytics/cls_world_brief.py` → DELETED
  - [ ] All imports updated throughout codebase
  - [ ] All tests passing
  - [ ] No re-exports remain
- **Files to Update:**
  - `src/spec1_core/__init__.py` (remove re-exports)
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/*.py` (update imports)
  - `src/mcp_server.py` (update imports)
  - `tests/*.py` (update imports)
- **Testing:** 
  - `grep -r "from spec1_core import cls_" src/ tests/` → should return nothing
  - `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` → all passing
- **Commits:**
  - `refactor: remove re-export shims (cls_leads, cls_psyop, cls_world_brief)`
---
#### TASK 1.3: Add API Versioning (/api/v1/ prefix)
- **Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL (blocks future API stability)
- **Scope:** Prefix all HTTP routes with `/api/v1/`
- **Time Estimate:** 1-2 days
- **Files to Update:**
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/health.py` → `/api/v1/health`
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/signals.py` → `/api/v1/signals`

  - `src/spec1_api/routers/leads.py` → `/api/v1/leads`
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/brief.py` → `/api/v1/brief`
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/psyop.py` → `/api/v1/psyop`
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/fara.py` → `/api/v1/fara`
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/verdicts.py` → `/api/v1/verdicts`
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/calibration.py` → `/api/v1/calibration`
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/cycle.py` → `/api/v1/cycle/run`
  - `docs/api.md` (update all examples)
  - `tests/test_api.py` (update all test paths)
- **Deliverables:**
  - [ ] All routes prefixed with `/api/v1/`
  - [ ] Documentation updated
  - [ ] Tests updated and passing
  - [ ] Migration guide added to CHANGELOG (breaking change)
- **Testing:** `pytest tests/test_api.py -v`
- **Commits:**
  - `breaking: add /api/v1/ prefix to all routes`
  - `docs: update API examples for /api/v1/`
---
### Week 2-3: Operator Tool Audit
#### TASK 1.4: Audit & Document Operator Tools
- **Status:** 🟡 MEDIUM (tools exist but entry points are unclear)
- **Problem:** Makefile targets reference tools that may not be callable as modules
- **Solution:** Ensure every operator tool is:
  - Callable as `python -m spec1_core.tools.<tool>`
  - Documented in docs/runbook.md
  - Tested in test suite
  - Listed in pyproject.toml `[project.scripts]`
- **Time Estimate:** 2-3 days
- **Operator Tools to Audit:**
  1. `generate_brief` → `python -m spec1_core.tools.generate_brief`
  2. `generate_leads` → `python -m spec1_core.tools.generate_leads`
  3. `run_psyop` → `python -m spec1_core.tools.run_psyop`
  4. `calibration_propose` → `python -m spec1_core.tools.calibration_propose`
  5. `historical_briefs` → `python -m spec1_core.tools.historical_briefs`
  6. `pdf_render` → `python -m spec1_core.tools.pdf_render`
- **Deliverables:**
  - [ ] Each tool has a `__main__.py` entry point
  - [ ] `pyproject.toml` lists all tools under `[project.scripts]`
  - [ ] Makefile targets verified working
  - [ ] docs/runbook.md documents each tool (usage, parameters, output)
  - [ ] Each tool has tests in test suite
  - [ ] `python -m spec1_core.tools.<tool> --help` works
- **Testing:**
  - `python -m spec1_core.tools.generate_brief --help`
  - `python -m spec1_core.tools.run_psyop --help`
  - `make brief` → works
  - `make psyop` → works
  - `make calibration` → works
  - `pytest tests/test_tools.py -v`
- **Commits:**
  - `feat: add entry points for all operator tools`
  - `docs: document operator tool usage in runbook.md`
---
### Week 3-4: Verdict Filing UI
#### TASK 1.5: Build Verdict-Filing Web UI
- **Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL (makes feedback loop real for non-technical users)
- **Scope:** Single-page HTML form to file verdicts on intelligence records
- **Time Estimate:** 5-7 days
- **Deliverables:**
  - [ ] HTML form at `/verdicts/` (served by spec1_api)
  - [ ] Form captures: `record_id`, `verdict_kind`, `notes`, `reviewer_name`
  - [ ] Form submits to `POST /api/v1/verdicts/` (existing endpoint)
  - [ ] Form shows recent records from `GET /api/v1/intel` for easy browsing
  - [ ] Form stores verdicts to `verdicts.jsonl`
  - [ ] Integration tests for form submission
- **Files to Create:**
  - `src/spec1_api/static/verdicts.html` (form UI)
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/static.py` (route for `/verdicts/`)
- **Form Design (Sacred Geometry):**
  - Black/white only
  - Monospace font (IBM Plex Mono)
  - Geometric grid layout
  - No color accents
- **Features:**
  - Record search/filter by record_id or domain
  - Recent records carousel (last 10 analyzed)
  - Verdict kind selector (correct / incorrect / partial / unclear)
  - Notes textarea (optional)
  - Reviewer name field (pre-fill from env var if available)
  - Submit button → stores to verdicts.jsonl
  - Success message with count
- **Testing:**
  - `pytest tests/test_verdicts.py -v`
  - Manual: Visit http://localhost:8000/verdicts/ → submit form → check verdicts.jsonl
- **Commits:**
  - `feat: build verdict-filing web UI at /verdicts/`
  - `test: add integration tests for verdict submission`
---
### Week 4-6: Persistence Layer Systematization
#### TASK 1.6: Systematize Persistence (Dual-Write + Repositories + API)
- **Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL (enables scaling, querying, and enterprise features)
- **Current State:** Only verdicts have full dual-write; other stores are JSONL-only
- **Goal:** Every store (signals, intel, leads, briefs, psyop, calibration) has:
  - JSONL append-only write path
  - SQLite dual-write via `cls_db.dual_write`
  - Repository abstraction (read interface)
  - API read endpoint
- **Time Estimate:** 10-14 days
- **Stores to Systematize:**

| Store | JSONL | SQLite | Repository | API Endpoint | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|--------------|--------|
| Signals | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | GET /api/v1/signals | ✓ Complete |
| Intelligence Records | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | GET /api/v1/intel | ✓ Complete |
| Leads | ✓ | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Partial | ✓ Complete | ⚠️ WIP |
| Briefs | ✓ | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Partial | ✓ Complete | ⚠️ WIP |
| PsyOp Scores | ✓ | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Partial | ✓ Complete | ⚠️ WIP |
| Calibration Reports | ✓ | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Partial | GET /api/v1/calibration | ⚠️ WIP |
| Verdicts | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | GET /api/v1/verdicts | ✓ Complete |

- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Add SQLite models for leads, briefs, psyop, calibration (if not present)
  - [ ] Add repository abstractions for each store
  - [ ] Wire dual_write into each store's write path
  - [ ] Add read endpoints for each store (API routers)
  - [ ] Update docs/architecture.md with persistence status
  - [ ] All tests passing
- **Files to Modify:**
  - `src/cls_db/models.py` (add SQLite schemas)
  - `src/cls_db/repository.py` (add CRUD methods)
  - `src/cls_world_brief/store.py` (add dual_write)
  - `src/cls_leads/store.py` (add dual_write)
  - `src/cls_psyop/store.py` (add dual_write)
  - `src/cls_calibration/store.py` (add dual_write)
  - `src/spec1_api/routers/*.py` (use repositories)
  - `tests/test_persistence.py` (add new tests)
- **Testing:**
  - `pytest tests/test_persistence.py -v`
  - Manual: Run cycle → check both JSONL and SQLite contain records
  - API: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/intel | jq` → should return records
- **Commits:**
  - `feat: add SQLite models for all stores`
  - `feat: add repository abstractions for all stores`
  - `feat: enable dual-write for leads, briefs, psyop, calibration`
  - `test: add comprehensive persistence tests`

## PHASE 2: POSITIONING & COMMERCIAL PATHS (Weeks 9-16)
### Goal: Build distinct positioning for core engine vs. analytics; enable multiple monetization paths
### Week 9: Repo Organization & Planning
#### TASK 2.1: Reorganize `src/` for Future Modularity (in-repo only)
- **Status:** 🟡 MEDIUM (folder rename within `mjlak1000/spec-1` — no repo split yet)
- **Goal:** Reorganize `src/` so `spec1_core` and `spec1_analytics` are visually distinct,
  making a future optional repo split straightforward without requiring one now.
- **Scope:** Folder renames inside `mjlak1000/spec-1` only. No new repositories.
- **Time Estimate:** 2-3 days
- **Repo layout after this task:**
  ```
  mjlak1000/spec-1          ← everything stays here (Phase 1 & 2)
  └── src/
      ├── spec1_core/           ← harvest → verify → store (canonical cycle)
      │   ├── signal/
      │   ├── investigation/
      │   ├── intelligence/
      │   └── core/
      ├── spec1_analytics/      ← briefs, leads, psyop
      │   ├── cls_world_brief/
      │   ├── cls_leads/
      │   └── cls_psyop/
      ├── spec1_api/            ← HTTP + MCP surfaces
      ├── cls_osint/            ← adapters
      ├── cls_verdicts/         ← feedback
      ├── cls_calibration/      ← feedback
      └── cls_db/               ← persistence
  ```
- **Future repo split (Phase 3+, optional — only if justified):**
  ```
  spec-1-core        ← AGPL open-source engine (extracted from spec1_core/)
  spec-1-analytics   ← Proprietary analytics layer (extracted from spec1_analytics/)
  spec-1-saas        ← Proprietary SaaS/hosting layer
  ```
  Monorepo is equally valid; split only if licensing or team boundaries demand it.
- **Deliverables:**
  - [ ] `src/spec1_core/` (done — renamed from spec1_engine + all imports updated)
  - [ ] `src/cls_world_brief/`, `src/cls_leads/`, `src/cls_psyop/` → `src/spec1_analytics/`
  - [ ] All other top-level packages (`cls_osint`, `cls_verdicts`, etc.) remain at `src/`
  - [ ] All imports updated throughout codebase
  - [ ] All tests passing
  - [ ] docs/architecture.md updated to show new structure
  - [ ] No functional changes
- **Commits:**
  - `refactor: reorganize src/ into spec1_core/ and spec1_analytics/ (in-repo)`
---
#### TASK 2.2: Plan Independent Portfolio Site
- **Status:** 🟡 MEDIUM (planning + design, no code yet)
- **Goal:** Design separate marketing site (not GitHub Pages) with positioning.
  Lives in a **new repo `mjlak1000/spec-1-marketing`** — completely separate from the
  code repo so marketing changes never touch the engine.
- **Time Estimate:** 3-5 days (planning + design)
- **Deliverables:**
  - [ ] Domain name selected (e.g., spec1.ai, spec1intelligence.io)
  - [ ] `mjlak1000/spec-1-marketing` repo created (Next.js skeleton, README, deploy config)
  - [ ] Site architecture documented (landing, features, pricing, blog, docs, case studies)
  - [ ] Positioning content drafted (open-source core vs. commercial analytics)
  - [ ] Pricing tiers documented (free, pro, enterprise)
  - [ ] Hosting provider selected (Vercel recommended — native Next.js support)
#### TASK 2.1: Reorganize for Future Modularity
- **Status:** 🟡 MEDIUM (organizational change, no functional changes)
- **Goal:** Signal future separation of core engine + analytics without splitting yet
- **Time Estimate:** 2-3 days
- **Changes (Folder Structure Only):**
  ```
  Current:
  src/
  ├── spec1_core/
  └── cls_*/
  
  Reorganize to:
  src/
  ├── spec1_core/           ← harvest → verify → store (canonical cycle)
  │   ├── signal/
  │   ├── investigation/
  │   ├── intelligence/
  │   └── core/
  ├── spec1_analytics/      ← briefs, leads, psyop, quant
  │   ├── cls_world_brief/
  │   ├── cls_leads/
  │   ├── cls_psyop/
  │   └── cls_quant/
  ├── spec1_api/            ← HTTP + MCP surfaces
  ├── cls_osint/            ← adapters (keep top-level)
  ├── cls_verdicts/         ← feedback (keep top-level)
  ├── cls_calibration/      ← feedback (keep top-level)
  └── cls_db/               ← persistence (keep top-level)
  ```
- **Rationale:** Prepares for future `spec-1-core` (open-source engine) vs. `spec-1-analytics` (commercial)
- **Deliverables:**
  - [ ] Folders reorganized as above
  - [ ] All imports updated
  - [ ] All tests passing

3. **Phase 3:** Generate revenue (monetization)

Each phase has clear deliverables, success criteria, and gating decisions. The resource requirements scale from 1 FTE (Phase 1) to 2 FTE + sales (Phase 3), with total estimated cost of $95-155K (including team time).

The highest-leverage changes are:
1. Resolving the quant module (clarity)
2. Building the verdict UI (product)
3. Systematizing persistence (scalability)
4. Separating positioning (marketability)
5. Launching SaaS MVP (monetization)

**Execution discipline is more important than timeline perfection.** Follow the gating decisions; validate assumptions with real users; adjust roadmap based on market feedback. The goal is sustainable product business, not "go big or go home."
